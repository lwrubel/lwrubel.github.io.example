I am a librarian and software developer in the Scholarly Technology Group of the GW Libraries and work on a range of projects. Many of the applications I work on use Python and the Django web framework. I'm also part of a team providing consultations to students and faculty on programming and software development. I am currently the Principal Investigator on the grant from the National Historical Publications and Records Commission, "Building and Managing Social Media Collections".

## Current Interests and Projects:

* Python and Django
* Helping the GW community with technology resources and skills 
* Data sonification
* Biking and music
